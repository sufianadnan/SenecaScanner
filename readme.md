## Functionality

### Phishing Operation

- The application disguises itself as a malware scanner, presenting a benign interface to users.
- However, behind the scenes, it operates as a phishing tool to trick users into revealing their credentials.
- It targets multiple platforms, including PayPal, GitHub, school accounts, and Instagram, by mimicking their login pages.

### Web Interface

- The application provides a user-friendly web interface using Eel.
- Users are lured into interacting with the interface, believing it to be a legitimate malware scanner.
- However, the interface serves as a front for the phishing operation, collecting user credentials without their knowledge.

### Using Discord Webhook

- The application utilizes a Discord webhook to send information about the computer details and networking.
- Upon certain events or actions, such as completing a scan or gathering system information, the application sends a POST request to the specified Discord webhook URL.
- The payload sent to the webhook includes relevant details in a structured format, allowing users to receive notifications or logs of the application's activities on their Discord server or channel.
- This feature enhances monitoring and tracking capabilities, enabling users to stay informed about the operation of the phishing tool and any activities it performs on the compromised system.
